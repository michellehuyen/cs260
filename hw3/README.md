2. Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:

   1. What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?
      - A function that would insert an element (enqueue)
      - A funtion that would remove the head and make the next element in line the head (dequeue)
      - A function that gives you the value of the head

   2. What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?
      - The head

3. Based on what we know about linked lists, deisgn a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):

   1. What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?
      - A function that gives the index of a given value
      - A function that receives a value at a given index
      - A function that inserts a given value with a given index
      - A function that removes a given value at a given index

   2. What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?
      - Head of the array
      - Size of array.
